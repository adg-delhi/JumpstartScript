# Jumpstart Python Script
1. Copy this script at desired location.
2. execute `python android-jumpstart.py`
3. Follow on screen instructions and you should be good.

# Jumpstart Shell Script (Now Deprecated)
Please clone this repository at the desired location.
Put the file in the directory where you want to create new project.
Run `./JumpstartScript.sh ProjectDirectoryName` and your project is created.
If you need to create template for jumpstart again just go to directory and just JumpstartScript ProjectDirectoryName and Bang You get your new template. No need to add Copy JumpstartScript every-time in each folder. We took care of it for You.

### Deprecated as python script is much faster and DRY since it doesn't need a separate repo update every-time we modify Android-Jumpstart project.

# Happy Coding...
